## What is the Medical Device Club @ Vanderbilt?

We are a like-minded group of computer scientists, engineers, and clinicians that 
want to innovate healthcare through technology. We provide:

- a forum/community to have technical and clinical discussions about medical devices and technologies with subject area experts;
- help for our members to overcome technical challenges in their applications;
- opportunities to get involved in medical device and technology development;
- foster inventive ways to evaluate the efficacy/risk early in the design process as fast and as cheaply as possible

Also, the Medical Device Club aims to complement/support the Vanderbilt Institute 
for Surgery and Engineering by providing a weekly opportunity to innovate and discuss technical challenges.

## Should I get involved in the Medical Device Club?

We HIGHLY encourage __senior design teams__, __graduate researchers__, and __anyone working on medical technology projects__
to join the club and take advantage/participate in the community — we are a diverse 
group with experts spanning multiple engineering and medical disciplines. 
We like to think of the club as a teaching hospital for medical devices.
